A big thank you to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for sponsoring this project!

## What's BrowserStack?
BrowserStack is a cloud web and mobile testing platform that enables developers to test their websites and mobile applications across on-demand browsers, operating systems, and real mobile devices. Users can choose from more than 1,200 on-demand real mobile devices, browsers, and operating systems.

## How do we use BrowserStack
We received many complaints from users about compatibility issues and big features simply *not working* on certain devices or browsers. Obviously, this is quite a problem for our project. With BrowserStack, we can easily test all features on an (extremely) wide range of devices and browsers and can see where problems occur. Then we can identify the problem and fix it. BrowserStack's feature "Automate" is key here, since even small changes need to be tested on a wide range of devices and browsers. Doing this manually would be impossible for us.
Without BrowserStack we are only able to develop for our school computers. So BrowserStack enables us to expand our user base and really push out this project.
